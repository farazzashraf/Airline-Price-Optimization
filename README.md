# Airline Price Optimization
This repository contains code for simulating and optimizing pricing strategies for airline tickets. The code is written in Python and utilizes libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a framework for airlines to simulate different pricing strategies and analyze their effectiveness in maximizing revenue. By considering factors such as days until flight, number of seats left, and demand level, airlines can dynamically adjust ticket prices to optimize revenue.

### Code Overview
Flight Data Generation: Synthetic flight data is generated with random parameters such as initial seats, days until flight, and demand level.
Pricing Function: A pricing function is defined to calculate ticket prices based on the number of days left until the flight, seats left, and demand level.
Simulation Function: The simulate_pricing_strategy function simulates pricing strategies for each flight, calculating revenue generated for different scenarios.
Plotting Functions: Several plotting functions are provided to visualize revenue distribution, demand patterns, and pricing effectiveness.

### Example Output
plot_revenue_by_flight: Bar chart showing revenue generated by each flight.
plot_total_revenue_over_time: Line chart illustrating total revenue over time (days until flight).
aggregate_demand_levels_by_flight: Bar chart displaying average demand level for each flight.
aggregate_revenue_by_days_until_flight: Bar chart showing aggregate revenue by days until the flight.
plot_revenue_3d: 3D scatter plot depicting revenue by combination of seats left and demand level.
